# Speech-Reading-with-Deep-Neural-Networks
A machine learning model that can effectively identify spoken words from visual cues of lip movements in a video. This model can potentially enhance speech recognition accuracy for individuals with hearing impairments and in environments where audio-based speech recognition systems may not be effective due to noise interference. The ultimate goal is to provide a more accurate and reliable form of speech recognition that can improve communication accessibility for individuals in a variety of settings.

**Overview**:
This Python script implements a deep learning model for video captioning using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model takes input video data, processes it using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and generates captions describing the content of the videos.

**Key Components**:

Data Loading Functions: Functions to load video data from files, preprocess frames, and extract alignments.

Data Pipeline: Creation of a TensorFlow data pipeline for efficient data loading and processing.

Neural Network Architecture: Designing the deep learning model architecture using CNNs, RNNs, and other layers.

Loss Function: Implementation of the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function for training the model.

Training: Training the model on video-caption pairs with custom callbacks and learning rate scheduling.

Testing: Testing the trained model on video data and generating captions for evaluation.

**Requirements**:

Python 3

TensorFlow

OpenCV

Matplotlib

Imageio

gdown

**Usage**:

Ensure all the required libraries are installed.
Download the video data using the provided link and extract it to the specified directory.
Run the Python script video_captioning.py.
The script will load the data, train the model, and generate captions for test videos.

**Code Structure**:

video_captioning.py: Main Python script containing the video captioning model implementation.

checkpoints.zip: Pre-trained model checkpoints (downloaded from Google Drive).

data.zip: Video data files (downloaded from Google Drive).

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the code, its components, and usage instructions.

**Credits**:

The model architecture and training procedure are inspired by various research papers and online tutorials on video captioning.
The video data used for training and testing the model is sourced from public datasets and repositories.

**Notes**:

The script may require adjustments and fine-tuning based on specific dataset characteristics and project requirements.
